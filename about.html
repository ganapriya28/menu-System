  <h2>About Our Bakery</h2>
  <p>
  Ragam Bakery, established in 1992 in AECS Layout, Brookfield,
   has been a trusted neighbourhood destination for fresh and delicious bakery items for over three decades.
    From a small local shop, we have grown into a favourite spot known for our breads, puffs, cakes, and everyday treats.
     We bake everything in-house using carefully selected ingredients, ensuring consistent freshness, quality, and great taste.
      With a friendly team and a warm atmosphere, Ragam Bakery has become a part of the daily life of families, students, and working professionals in the area.
       Our menu continues to evolve with both classic favourites and modern flavours, while our commitment to hygiene, taste, and customer satisfaction remains the same. 
       Whether it’s a morning snack, an evening bite, or a special celebration, Ragam Bakery is here to serve you with care.
